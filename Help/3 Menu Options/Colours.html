<h1>Colours</h1>
<p>
There are 2 options for how the colours are determined in Giraph.

The default option - the colours are not directly determined by the positions 
of the circles on the screen, but by the proportion of overlapping genes between gene lists. 
</p>
<p>
The number of colours can be adjusted by selecting the coloured circle button.
</p>
<p><img src="coloursIcon.png" alt="Colours Icon"></p>
<p>
This brings up a slider bar which can be used to adjust the r value threshold
and increase or decrease the number of colours shown.
</p>

The alternative option uses colours determined by the proximity of the 
circles to each other on the screen
