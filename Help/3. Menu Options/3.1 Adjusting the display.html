<h1>Adjusting the display</h1>
<br />
The circles can be dragged around using the mouse to make the display clearer if necessary. 
A number of options can be selected to change some aspects of the display.
<br />
<br />
<h1>Colours</h1>
<h2>Changing the colour display</h2>
<img src="coloursIcon.png" alt="Colours Icon">
The positions of the circles on the screen are a representation of how closely linked the categories are. 
The colours are there for aesthetic reasons.  
<p>
There are 2 options for how the colours are determined in Giraph. <br />
<br />
In the default option the colours are determined by the proximity of the 
circles to each other on the screen.
<br />
<br />
In the alternative option the colours are not directly determined by the positions 
of the circles on the screen, but by the proportion of overlapping genes between gene lists. 
The clustering is calculated independently from the positions of the circles.
<br/>
These options can be toggled between by selecting the 3 coloured circles button on the tool bar 
</p>

<h2>Changing the number of colours</h2>
<img src="adjust_no_of_clusters.png" alt="Colours Icon">
<p>
The number of different colours can be adjusted by selecting the menu option with the small coloured circles as above. 
This brings up a slider bar which can be used to adjust the r value threshold
and increase or decrease the number of colours shown.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Removing categories</h2>
<img src="delete_circle.png" alt="Colours Icon">
<p>
A category can be selected by clicking on the circle. This will highlight the circle and the category name will be displayed.
<br />
<br />
A selected category can be deleted from the display by selecting the 'delete circle' menu item. <br />
This is only deleted from the current view. If the p-value is adjusted, the display is reset.
</p> 
<br />
<br />
<h1>Adjusting lines</h1>
<img src="fewer_lines.png" alt="fewer lines">
<img src="more_lines.png">
<img src="remove_lines.png">

<p>
The darker the lines, the greater the proportion of genes that overlap between 2 functional categories. <br />
The number of lines shown can be increased, decreased or all the lines can be removed from the display.  
</p> 
<br />
<br />
<h1>Displaying the category names</h1>
<img src="functional_annotations.png" alt="category name Icon">
<p>
Placing the cursor over a circle will highlight it and the category name will be displayed.  
Clicking on the circle has a similar effect. 
Clicking on an area of empty space within the display will stop the category name from being displayed.
<br />
All of the category names can be displayed by selecting the menu option, and removed by selecting it again. 
</p>
<h1>Changing the p-value threshold</h1>
<img src="filter_by_pvalue.png" alt="category name Icon">
<p>
To filter the results by significance, select the p-value icon and enter the required p-value threshold.
All the results from the analysis or external file are kept, so the p-value threshold can be increased or decreased. 
</p>
<h1>Displaying information about the gene sets</h1>
<img src="functional_annotations.png" alt="category name Icon">
<p>
The info button brings up another panel. When a circle is selected, information about it is populated in the information panel.
The first, coloured line is the name of the
