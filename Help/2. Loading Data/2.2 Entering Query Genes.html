<h1>Entering a list of genes</h1>
<h2>Query genes</h2>
<p>
A list of genes can be pasted in to the query gene field.
They must be gene symbols. 
</p>
<br>
<h2>Background genes</h2>
<p>
By default all the genes in the genome (is this all that are in the gmt file??) are used as the background set.
This is not usually the most appropriate set. 
Custom background genes can be entered by changing the dropdown box from 'Use all genes in genome' 
to 'Enter custom background genes'. The background genes can then be pasted in. Again, these must be gene symbols.  
</p>

<h2>Setting options</h2>
<h3>p-value</h3>
The p-value can be adjusted before the data is loaded - this may be preferable if the data produces a large number of 
significant categories. It can be adjusted further once the data has been loaded and processed. For more details on 
the p-value see the help page p-value help....
<h3>Number of genes in functional category</h3>
This refers to the processing of the gmt file. The functional categories can contain as few as 1 gene or many thousands of genes. 
At the extremes these categories aren't very useful so it is preferable to filter these out.
