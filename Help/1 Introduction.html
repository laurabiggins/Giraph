<h1>What is Giraph</h1>
<p>
Giraph is a program for visualising the results of gene ontology and other 
functional analyses. There is often a lot of redundancy in the results of 
functional analysis of gene sets.
</p>
<p>
Giraph provides a graphical way to explore and present results.
Each circle represents a functional category. 
The size of the circle is related to the number of genes from the query list are in the category.
The proximity of the circles is related to how many genes overlap between the sets.
</p>
