<h1>What is Giraph</h1>
<p>
Giraph provides a graphical way to explore and present results of gene ontology and other 
functional analyses.
There is often a lot of redundancy in the results of functional analysis of gene sets, so Giraph groups similar functional categories together. 

</p>

<h2>How does Giraph represent the gene sets?</h2>
<p>
Each circle represents a functional category. 
The size of the circle is related to the number of genes from the query list are in the category.
The proximity of the circles is related to how many genes overlap between the sets.
</p>

<h2>What input data is required</h2>
<p>
A list of gene names can be entered.<br> 

OR<br>

Giraph can accept the output of functional analyses from other programs.
